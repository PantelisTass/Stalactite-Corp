# Stalactite-Corp

ðŸ‘‹ Greetings from Pantelis, Yiorgos, Riho and Spyros. 

At Stalactite, we apply mathematical models to the financial world. This is done through online paper trading in virtual stock exchanges. We test models such as Markowitz Portfolio Theory. More specifically, we create virtual portfolios based on the theory and monitor their return rates. We are planning to expand our modelling to more asset classes including Derivatives, Forex and Cryptocurrencies.

We would be delighted for you to have a look at our work herein and any feedback and insights are welcome.
